Description: De novo identification and extraction of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the human genome using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array data. Provides functionality for filtering probes possibly confounded by SNPs and cross-hybridisation. Includes bedGraph generation, significance tracks as BigWig files, GRanges generation and plotting functions. Allows collapsing of SummarizedExperiment-derived datasets over DMRs or VMRs for predictions.
